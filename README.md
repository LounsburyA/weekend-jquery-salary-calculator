## Description

This project was to create  an application that records employee salaries and adds salaries per month up to report monthly costs. 
The application needed to take in employee information and store/display it in a table.
Employee information inputs:
-First Name
-Last Name
-ID number
-Title
-Annual salary

It also needed to display the total monthly cost calculated from the employee inputs.
Initial task was to create the structure. Inputs for employee first name, last name, ID number, title, and annual salary were created, as well as a button to submit this information.
Next the table structure was created to store the submitted employee information.

Then was functionality.  A submit button was created.  This button ran a function that appended all the entered information and stored it in the table.  It also calculated the monthly total and displayed that as well.  This function also cleared the inputs so they could be used again.

A button to delete employee information from the table was also created.  This ran a function that would empty the employee information that was in the table.

Finally a function was created that would turn the total monthly background red if it was in excess of 20,000.
